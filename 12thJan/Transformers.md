## Fine-tuning 
A process of taking a pre-trained model and further training (or "fine-tuning") it on a specific dataset for a specific task. 

This concept is central to how modern NLP models are used, as it allows for the customization of general-purpose language models to perform well on particular tasks or datasets.

### Key Features:
**Adaptability:** Fine-tuning allows pre-trained models to adapt to specific domains or tasks.

**Efficiency:** Reduces the need for training a model from scratch, saving time and computational resources (costs).

**Customization:** Enables customization of models to suit unique requirements of different NLP tasks.

**Improved Performance:** Fine-tuning often leads to better model performance on specific tasks compared to using generic pre-trained models.

## Transformers
