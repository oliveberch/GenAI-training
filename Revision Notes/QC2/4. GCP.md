  - Object storage for unstructured data.
  - Scalable, durable, and can be accessed directly from applications.

- **Cloud SQL:**
  - Managed relational databases.
  - Supports MySQL, PostgreSQL, and SQL Server.

- **Filestore:**
  - NoSQL document database.
  - Suited for real-time updates and scalable for web, mobile, and server apps.

## Data and Analytics:

### Data Storage:
- **BigQuery:**
  - Serverless, highly scalable data warehouse for analytics.
  - SQL-like queries on large datasets.

- **Datastore:**
  - NoSQL database for web and mobile applications.
  - Scales horizontally and is globally distributed.

### Data Processing:
- **Dataflow:**
  - Process and analyze streaming and batch data.
  - Serverless, fully managed.

### Messaging and Event-Driven Systems:
- **Pub/Sub:**
  - Messaging service for building event-driven systems.
  - Allows communication between independently developed applications.

## Machine Learning and AI:

- **AI Platform:**
  - End-to-end platform for building, testing, and deploying machine learning models.
  - Supports popular machine learning frameworks.

- **Pre-trained Models:**
  - Vision AI, Video AI, Natural Language Processing models available in model garden.
  - Ready-made models for specific tasks, reducing development time.


## Machine Learning and AI:
- **AI Platform:** Tools for building, testing, and deploying machine learning models.
- **Vision AI, Video AI, Natural Language Processing:** Pre-trained models for specific tasks.

## Networking:

- **Virtual Private Cloud (VPC):**
  - Network resources in a private, isolated environment.
  - Offers control over the network.

- **Load Balancing:**
  - Distributes incoming network traffic across multiple instances.
  - Enhances application availability and fault tolerance.


## Security and Identity:

- **Identity and Access Management (IAM):**
  - Manages access and permissions to Google Cloud resources.
  - Fine-grained control over who can do what.

- **Security Command Center:**
  - Security and risk management platform.
  - Helps detect and respond to threats.

## Developer Tools:

- **Cloud SDK:**
  - Command-line tools for Google Cloud services.
  - Automates repetitive tasks.

- **Cloud Source Repositories:**
  - Git repositories for source code.
  - Integrated with Google Cloud Platform.

## Hybrid and Multi-cloud:

- **Anthos:**
  - Platform for managing applications across multiple clouds.
  - Modernizes and migrates existing applications.

## Billing and Cost Management:

- **Cloud Billing:**
  - Flexible billing solutions with detailed usage reports.
  - Allows monitoring and optimizing costs.

## Google Cloud Platform (GCP) Terminologies for QC

### Bucket:
- In GCP, a **bucket** is a container for storing and organizing objects (files/data).
- Buckets are used within Cloud Storage to manage and control access to data.

### S3 Bucket:
- An **S3 bucket** refers to a container in Amazon Simple Storage Service (S3), Amazon Web Services' (AWS) object storage.
- It serves a similar purpose to a GCP bucket in storing and managing data.

### Access Levels:
- **Access levels** in GCP refer to the permissions granted to users or entities for accessing resources.
- It defines the extent of control and actions a user can perform on a resource.

### SSH (Secure Shell) 
SSH is a protocol used to connect to remote servers securely. In Google Cloud Platform (GCP), you can use SSH to connect to your virtual machine instances. 

### Static Website:
- GCP allows hosting a **static website** using Cloud Storage.
- By configuring a bucket for static website hosting, you can serve HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files directly.

### Managed instance groups (MIGs)
MIG in Google Cloud Platform (GCP) are groups of identical virtual machines (VMs) that are treated as a single entity. Each VM in a MIG is based on an instance template and has the same machine type, image, and configuration.

### GCP Classification:

- GCP classification typically refers to categorizing data based on sensitivity or regulatory requirements.
- It involves labeling data to enforce security and compliance policies.

### Security Groups - IAM:

Security group is same as google group. where google group is used for mailing list. Security group is useed for IAM. 

### User Account or Service Account:
- **User accounts** represent individual users, while **service accounts** are used for applications or virtual machines.
- Service accounts are often preferred for machine-to-machine communication within GCP.

### Permissions:
- **Permissions** in GCP define what actions users, groups, or service accounts are allowed to perform.
- They are assigned to identities at various levels in the resource hierarchy.

### Keys to Access:
- GCP uses **keys** (such as service account keys) for authentication and authorization.
- These keys are cryptographic credentials that grant access to resources.

### Inbound and Outbound Rules:
- In GCP, **inbound rules** control incoming network traffic, while **outbound rules** control outgoing traffic.
- These rules are part of the network configuration, specifying what is allowed or denied.

### We Can Access Application Via:
- Applications in GCP can be accessed via various means, including:
  - **HTTP/HTTPS:** For web applications.
  - **SSH:** Secure Shell for accessing virtual machines.
  - **APIs:** Programmatic access to services and resources.



# NOTE: for project
In bigquery studio - 
- click Add > Upload data > Create Table > 
- In queries, you can add query on a table

any cloud could be accesed using:

- console
- api access
- key pair (not in GCP)
