## AI:
development of computer systems that can perform tasks that typically requiring human intelligence
- Subset: Machine Learning (ML) and Generative AI (GenAI). 

## Machine Learning (ML):
A process by which a system improves performance from experience.

Development of algorithms and models that enable computers to learn from data, instead of relying on explicit programming.
- Equation: 
\(f(x) = wx + b\).
- Model Training: Requires data (supervised or unsupervised).

## Types:

**Supervised:**   
- Uses labeled data.
- Types:
1. Regression: Predict continuous output variable.
2. Classification: Predict discrete class label.

**Unsupervised:** 
- Model trained on unlabeled data.
- Types:
1. Clustering: Group similar instances together.
2. Non Clustering: 

**Self-Supervised Learning:** 
- ML model creates its own Large Language Model (LLM).

**Semi-Supervised:**
- A mix of supervised and unsupervised learning.

**Reinforcement:**
- Agent interacts with an environment to maximize reward.

**DPO:** 
- direct preference optimization, adds a layer to model just for a reward system.

**Transfer Learning in Machine Learning:**
- Reusing a pre-trained model on a new problem.
- Application: Pre-trained models leverage knowledge gained from a previous task to improve generalization on a new task.

## Generative Models:
-  Capable of generating new examples that are similar to the training set.
- Used for generating new content based on the patterns learned from existing data.

**Predictive AI vs. Discriminative AI vs. Generative AI:**
- Predictive AI:   
  - Forecast future outcomes based on historical data.
  - Eg. algorithms analyze past market trends to predict future stock prices.

- Discriminative AI: 
  - Categorizes data into distinct classes or categories.
  - Eg. a model distinguishe between different objects or entities in images.
  
- Generative AI: 
  - Generates images, texts, sounds.
  - Eg. Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) in computer vision, which generate realistic images by learning from a dataset.
