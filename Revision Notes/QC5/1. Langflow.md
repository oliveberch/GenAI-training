## Langflow Overview:

### Introduction
   - Langflow is a prototyping tool for LangChain flows.
   - Features drag-and-drop functionality for easy experimentation.
   - Built-in chat interface for real-time interaction.
   - Allows editing prompt parameters, creating chains, agents, and tracking thought processes.
   - Supports flow export.

### Installation
   - Install Langflow using pip: `pip install langflow`.
   - Run Langflow: `langflow`.

### Creating Flows
   - Compose flows by dragging components onto the canvas.
   - Components include LLMs, prompt serializers, agents, and chains.
   - Fork community examples for quick start.
   - Build flows to validate prerequisites before execution.

### Sign up and Sign in
   - Authentication and protection of sensitive routes.
   - Enhanced login mechanism with environment variables.
   - Crucial environment variables: `LANGFLOW_AUTO_LOGIN`, `LANGFLOW_SUPERUSER`, `LANGFLOW_SUPERUSER_PASSWORD`, `LANGFLOW_SECRET_KEY`, `LANGFLOW_NEW_USER_IS_ACTIVE`.

### CLI Commands
   - `langflow run --env-file .env`: Run Langflow with environment file.
   - `langflow superuser`: Command-line utility for managing superusers.

### Sign-up
   - Sign-up required when `LANGFLOW_AUTO_LOGIN` is set to False.
   - Profile settings accessible through the dropdown menu.
   - Admin page for superusers.

### API Keys
   - Generate API keys through Langflow UI.
   - Use API keys in requests for authentication.
   - Security considerations: Visibility, Scope, Revoking keys.

### Asynchronous Processing
   - Introduces sync flag for asynchronous processing.
   - Experimental feature with potential API changes.
   - Check task status using `/task/{task_id}` endpoint.

### Components
   - Building blocks of flows, including inputs, outputs, and parameters.
   - Features handles for connections and status icons.
   - Edit components in the settings button.

### Features
   - Import, export, code, and save options.
   - Customizable styling for chat window.
   - Multilingual support.
   - Collection for local storage and future use.

### Prompt Customization
   - Create prompts with variables in curly brackets.
   - Variables can represent instructions, questions, context, etc.
   - Use documents or output parsers as prompt variables.

### Chat Interface
   - User-friendly chat interface for model interaction.
   - Edit pre-defined prompt variables in the sidebar.
   - View and edit variables in real-time during chat.
   - Chat widget for easy integration into web applications.

### Custom Components
   - Extend functionality with user-defined reusable components.
   - Create a class inheriting from `CustomComponent`.
   - Use `build` method for component logic and `build_config` for field customization.
   - Example: Document Processor for text transformations.

### Loading Custom Components
   - Organize custom components in a dedicated folder structure.
   - Set `LANGFLOW_COMPONENTS_PATH` environment variable or use `--components-path` argument to load components.
   - Interact with custom components through the Langflow sidebar.

## Flowise

**1. What is Flowise?**
Flowise is a low-code/no-code drag & drop tool designed to simplify the visualization and development of LLM (Language Model) apps.

**2. Getting Started:**
- Prerequisite: Ensure the latest Node.js is installed.
- Quick Start:
  - Install Flowise: `npm install -g flowise`
  - Start Flowise: `npx flowise start`
- Docker:
  - Use Docker Compose in the project's docker folder.
  - Build and run the Docker image locally.

**3. Developers:**
- Flowise has three modules in a mono repository: server, ui, and components.
- Prerequisite: Install Yarn globally with `npm i -g yarn`.
- Setup:
  - Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/FlowiseAI/Flowise.git`
  - Navigate to the repository folder: `cd Flowise`
  - Install dependencies: `yarn install`
  - Build code: `yarn build`
  - Start the app: `yarn start`  

**4. API:**
- Flowise provides APIs for Prediction, Vector Upsert, and Chat Messages.
- Example Python code for Prediction API included.

**5. Embed:**
- Embed a chat widget in your website using provided code.
- Customize the embedded chat widget UI by forking the repository.

**6. Variables:**
- Flowise allows users to create static or runtime variables for Custom Tool Functions.

**7. Analytics:**
- Integrates with various analytics providers.
- Configure analytics through UI or API.

**8. Telemetry:**
- Built-in telemetry collects anonymous usage information.
- Events include chatflow_created, tool_created, assistant_created, vector_upserted, and prediction_sent.

**9. Disable Telemetry:**
- Users can disable telemetry by setting `DISABLE_FLOWISE_TELEMETRY` to true in the .env file.

**10. Integrations:**
- Nodes in Flowise are referred to as integrations, offering a range of functionalities.
