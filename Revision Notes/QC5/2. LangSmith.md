Langsmith

## **LangSmith Notes:**

LangSmith is a robust platform designed for developing production-grade Large Language Model (LLM) applications. It serves as a versatile tool for debugging, testing, evaluating, and monitoring chains and intelligent agents, seamlessly integrating with LangChain â€“ an open-source framework widely recognized for LLM applications.

### **Tracing Overview:**
LangSmith boasts best-in-class tracing capabilities, applicable whether utilizing LangChain or not. This feature proves invaluable in troubleshooting issues like unexpected results, agent loops, slow chain performance, and tracking token usage at each step.

**Tracing Quick Start:**
Getting started with LangSmith tracing is straightforward and can be initiated using LangChain, the Python SDK, TypeScript SDK, or the API. Below are quick start steps for LangChain:

1. Install or upgrade LangChain using:
   ```bash
   pip install langchain_openai langchain_core
   ```

2. Create an API key and configure your environment:
   ```bash
   export LANGCHAIN_TRACING_V2=true
   export LANGCHAIN_API_KEY=<your-api-key>
   export OPENAI_API_KEY=<your-openai-api-key>
   ```

3. Log a trace without additional code modifications. Run your LangChain code as usual.

4. View the trace, which defaults to the project named 'default'.

### **Concepts:**
Understanding LangSmith involves key concepts related to runs, traces, and projects:

- **Runs:** Representing single units of work, runs cover operations within an LLM application.
- **Traces:** Collections of related runs tied to a single operation.
- **Projects:** Containers for traces, organizing them by application or service.

**Feedback:**
Feedback in LangSmith allows scoring individual runs based on specific criteria. Feedback entries consist of tags and scores, providing insights into run performance. Feedback can be collected through UI annotations or programmatically logged into LangSmith.

- **Tags:** String collections categorizing runs for easier search and analysis.
- **Metadata:** Key-value pairs attached to runs, storing additional information for filtering and analysis.

### **Evaluation:**
Given the probabilistic nature of LLM applications, proper evaluation becomes crucial. LangSmith facilitates experimentation, iteration, and decision-making by providing a framework to:

- Experiment with prompts and assess performance changes.
- Iterate on RAG architecture without guesswork.
- Quickly decide on model upgrades.
- Determine optimal model choices based on cost and performance.

**Evaluation Concepts:**
Important concepts in evaluating LLM applications include examples, datasets, llm_or_chain_factory, evaluators, EvaluationResult, RunEvalConfig, and Project Name.

- **Examples:** Individual datapoints for evaluating chains, agents, or models.
- **Datasets:** Collections of examples with common schemas.
- **llm_or_chain_factory:** Application or logic to evaluate, either stateful or stateless.
- **Evaluators:** Functions scoring system performance on specific examples.
- **EvaluationResult:** Result of an evaluator on a datapoint, comprising a key and score.
- **RunEvalConfig:** Configuration for an evaluation run.

### **Monitoring:**
LangSmith provides monitoring capabilities for tracking key metrics over time, ensuring desirable results at scale. It includes charts for Trace Latency, Tokens/Second, Cost, and feedback charts. The Monitoring tab in the Project dashboard facilitates high-level overviews, enabling users to inspect and analyze application performance.

LangSmith's monitoring features aid in debugging production issues and ensuring optimal application performance, especially when dealing with latency, cost, and feedback scores. The platform allows for A/B testing by grouping and marking different versions of applications for comparative analysis.
