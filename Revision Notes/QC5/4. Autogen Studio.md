## AutoGen Studio

**Overview:**
AutoGen Studio is an interactive interface powered by AutoGen, designed to facilitate the rapid prototyping of multi-agent workflows. This tool enables users to declaratively define, modify agents, and orchestrate multi-agent collaborations through an intuitive point-and-click, drag-and-drop interface. AutoGen Studio offers a user-friendly environment for creating, managing, and interacting with agents capable of learning, adapting, and collaborating.

**Key Features:**
1. **Declarative Agent and Workflow Definition:**
   - Users can define and modify agents and multi-agent workflows through an intuitive interface, allowing for easy configuration of agent properties and collaboration workflows.

2. **User Interaction and Results Viewing:**
   - The UI allows users to create chat sessions with specified agents, providing a view of chat history, generated files, and the time taken for task completion.

3. **Skill Addition to Agents:**
   - Agents can be explicitly enhanced with skills, which are functions (e.g., Python functions) describing how to solve a task. These skills are made available to assistant agents during task addressing.

4. **Publishing Sessions to a Local Gallery:**
   - Users can publish their sessions to a local gallery, enabling easy sharing and reusing of agent workflows, configurations, and artifacts.

**Installation:**
AutoGen Studio can be installed either from PyPi or from the source code.

**Install from PyPi:**
```bash
pip install autogenstudio
```

**Install from Source:**
1. Clone the AutoGen Studio repository.
2. Install Python dependencies by running:
   ```bash
   pip install -e .
   ```
3. Navigate to the `samples/apps/autogen-studio/frontend` directory, install dependencies, and build the UI:
   ```bash
   npm install -g gatsby-cli
   npm install --global yarn
   yarn install
   yarn build
   ```

**Running the Application:**
Once installed, run the web UI by entering the following in your terminal:
```bash
autogenstudio ui --port 8081
```
Access the application by opening your web browser and navigating to http://localhost:8081/.

**Getting Started:**
1. **Configuring an LLM Provider:**
   - Access to a language model is required. Follow the steps in the AutoGen documentation to set up and configure your environment with either `OPENAI_API_KEY` or `AZURE_OPENAI_API_KEY`.

   Example:
   ```bash
   export OPENAI_API_KEY=<your_api_key>
   ```

   Alternatively, specify the model directly in the agent's configuration.

   ```python
   llm_config = LLMConfig(
       config_list=[{
           "model": "gpt-4",
           "api_key": "<azure_api_key>",
           "base_url": "<azure api base url>",
           "api_type": "azure",
           "api_version": "2023-06-01-preview"
       }],
       temperature=0,
   )
   ```

2. **Installation:**
   - Install AutoGen Studio using either the PyPi package or the source code.

3. **Running the Application:**
   - Start the application on the specified port with the following command:
     ```bash
     autogenstudio ui --port 8081
     ```
   - Access the application through http://localhost:8081/.

**AutoGen Studio UI Sections:**

1. **Build:**
   - Specify agents, skills, and agent workflows.
   - Define agent properties and workflows declaratively.

2. **Playground:**
   - Interact with agent workflows defined in the Build section.
   - Create sessions and view chat interactions.

3. **Gallery:**
   - Share and reuse artifacts such as workflow configurations, sessions, etc.
   - Publish sessions to a local gallery.

**AutoGen Studio API:**
While AutoGen Studio provides a web interface, it is powered by a reusable and modular Python API. The API allows for the declarative specification, loading, and running of agent workflows. An example of using the API is provided below.

```python
import json
from autogenstudio import AutoGenWorkFlowManager, AgentWorkFlowConfig

# Load an agent specification in JSON
agent_spec = json.load(open('agent_spec.json'))

# Create an AutoGen Workflow Configuration from the agent specification
agent_work_flow_config = FlowConfig(**agent_spec)

# Create a Workflow from the configuration
agent_work_flow = AutoGenWorkFlowManager(agent_work_flow_config)

# Run the workflow on a task
task_query = "What is the height of the Eiffel Tower?"
agent_work_flow.run(message=task_query)
```
