Questions on past sessions:

- what do differenet distances denote in use case?

    - cos theta: -1 to 1 
        - denotes angle between two vectors
        - comparing angle between two points

    - L2: 0 to infinity
        - denotes magnitude between two vectors
        - compares distance from origin and henceforth relative distance between two points

    - IP: 
        - denotes dot product of both cos and L2
        - here we compare both direction and magnitude of vectors for comparison
